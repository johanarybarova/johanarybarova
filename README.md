## Hi, I’m Johana 👋

Frontend Engineer working on **B2B, content-driven SaaS web platforms**, owning frontend delivery from architecture to production.

I design and maintain **React and Next.js systems** that need to scale across CMS-driven content, UI variants, and real production traffic. My work focuses on keeping frontend codebases **predictable, performant, and hard to break** as product requirements evolve.

I’m typically responsible for frontend architecture decisions, component system design, performance optimization on real users (Core Web Vitals), and building accessible, semantic UIs that support SEO and long-term maintainability. I also ship motion and micro-interactions where they add clarity, without compromising performance or accessibility.
