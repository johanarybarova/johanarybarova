## Hi, I’m Johana 👋

Frontend Engineer owning frontend delivery for **content-driven SaaS products**, from architecture to production.

I build **React and Next.js systems** that remain predictable and performant as content, traffic, and product requirements evolve. My work focuses on scalable component systems, CMS-driven UI variants, and real-user performance.
